# nvim (Neovim)

Work-in-progress trying to get the ultimate Neovim IDE setup for C++
development.

There are a lot of examples online using different package managers and
configuration choices. I've been watching YouTube videos and reading various
sites to figure out how to tweak it to my likings.

## Plugins

### LSP (Language Server Protocol)

The LSP server is `clangd`.

- Issues to resolve:
  - This plugin provides indentation recommendations but sometimes gets it
    wrong. I might have to disable auto-indenting if it gets too annoying.
